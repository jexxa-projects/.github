# Jexxa-Projects 

The Jexxa project pursues the goal of collecting and sharing methods for the development of durable software systems, such as Domain Driven Design.

Therefore, we provide libraries and tutorials to support and train development teams of durable business applications in their daily challenges.

If you have interest, questions, challenges, or success stories about durable systems and team development you are welcome to join this group, or start a discussion.
